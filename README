suckde - suckless desktop environment
-------------------------------------
suckde is an effort to share themes and configurations between suckless
programs. It's inspired in u/Liebach's SDE over at reddit [1].

Unlike SDE, suckde does not automatically theme your programs, it only 
provides utilities to build all of them at once, and given that you've 
configured your builds accordingly, can also update your configurations.

Batch build
-----------
For the batch build to work, each of your builds should be in 'rocks' folder.

Theming
-------
For the themes to work, your 'config.h' file in each build should include
'theme.h' that will define THEME_* macros, such as 'THEME_FONT', 
'THEME_RED', etc. These macros should be used instead of hard-coded strings,
and will be provided to each build by copying the suckde's 'theme.h' file. 
Defaults are in 'theme.def.h' and use 'base16-default-dark' theme by default.
